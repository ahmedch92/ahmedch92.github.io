# About me
I am a PhD Economics candidate at the University of Oklahoma. My research includes applied micro and macro issues with a particular focus on political economy and development. I am currently working on the effect of US state-level campaign contribution laws on welfare policy and the relationship between political ideology and productive capabilities in a sample of countries.
