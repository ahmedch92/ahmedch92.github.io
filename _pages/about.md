**About me**

I am a PhD Economics candidate at the University of Oklahoma. My research includes applied micro and macro issues with a particular focus on political economy, public economics, and development. I am currently working on the effect of US state-level campaign contribution laws on welfare policy, a cross-country analysis of the relationship between political ideology and productive capabilities, and the effect of political ideology and IMF partcipation and conditionality requirements (and vice versa).
